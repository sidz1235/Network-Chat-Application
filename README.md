Network Chat Application
# This basic project to avail client server application with login interface and a chat interface helps us to understand the usage of interface and connection between the interface and the working of client server environment

***************************************************************************************************************************************
## First set the server ips presently me server ip is 

"192.168.29.187"

Wherever u find this in all the main.py , server.py and client.py change it to your ip i.e,

steps for finding ipV4 address:

        press windows+R

        enter cmd 

        enter "ipconfig"

        list the ipV4 address

        in the programs i.e .py files replace them with this ip address

Make sure every client is connected to same ip and also to the same wifi


******************************************************Then Run only main.py ********************************************************

(to check the working of client.py make sure u run the server.py
running server.py is limited to one computer once the server is active client can run their program
so i insist to run the server.py only once in one of the computer whose server ip is taken)
